Bridge is played with a regular deck of 52 cards consisting of 4 colors: 
pikes - ♠ , mugs - ♥ , kara - ♦ and swords - ♣ . Each color has 13 cards with 
numbers/symbols: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K and A. In each distribution the 52 cards
of the deck is divided into 4 players, so each player receives 13 cards. The 13 
cards a player receives in a distribution are called the player's hand. Because 
the 4 hands arise randomly, usually a hand will have cards of all colors 
(e.g. 4 pikas, 3 hearts, 3 karas and 3 swords), but rarer distributions can also 
occur where a hand will have no cards from one (or even more colors) at all. 
The hand field should therefore contains the appropriate fields to represent any 
hand that arises.
