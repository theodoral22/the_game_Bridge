Bridge is played with a regular deck of 52 cards consisting of 4 colors: 
pikes - ♠ , mugs - ♥ , kara - ♦ and swords - ♣ . Each color has 13 cards with 
numbers/symbols: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K and A. In each distribution the 52 cards
of the deck is divided into 4 players, so each player receives 13 cards. The 13 
cards a player receives in a distribution are called the player's hand. Because 
the 4 hands arise randomly, usually a hand will have cards of all colors 
(e.g. 4 pikas, 3 hearts, 3 karas and 3 swords), but rarer distributions can also 
occur where a hand will have no cards from one (or even more colors) at all. 
The hand field should therefore contains the appropriate fields to represent any 
hand that arises.


In the file "hands.txt", which contains the cards of each hand, each hand consists of 13 entries, where each entry includes 2 characters 
(possibly separated by spaces or other whitespace characters):
-> The first character represents the rank/symbol of the card.
-> The second character represents the suit.
Note: To ensure all numbers are represented with a single character, the number
10 is represented by the letter T (from the English word "ten"). Additionally, 
the four suits (spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs) are represented by the 
following letters:
-> S (for spades)
-> H (for hearts)
-> D (for diamonds)
-> C (for clubs)
